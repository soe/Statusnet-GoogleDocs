* To understand exception handling and implement it

*****

To discuss
==========

* positioning of Google Docs attach button and attachment list without ajax
	* might need extra hooks
	* support of extensible widgets in Notice form and MicroApps

* advice on how to restructure the application
	* maybe for other cloud file services (Box.net, Dropbox etc)
	* and/or integrate better with current attachment feature
	* support multi-upload too?

To do
=====

* respect config's consumer key and secret
* improve googledocs/get logic, ACL management (both SN side and Google side)
* Clear the documents in Notice Form after successful posting
	* how to bind to the separate ajax call success?
* support new document creation
* Redirect user back to the last page after authorization
* do @fixme
* commenting
* testing and debugging
* align code with SN core coding flow
* improve usability, and user-facing functionality
* css touch-up, icons
